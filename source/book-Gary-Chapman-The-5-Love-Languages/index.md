Gary Chapman’s The 5 Love Languages:<br>The Secret to Love That Lasts
=====================================================================

In this book, Chapman reveals his take on rekindling dying marriages. He explores the motivations behind the kind of love that seems to last until after the wedding day. Through the encounters of couples he has counselled, he gives examples of broken marriages which have improved after following his advice. According to Chapman, there are languages in which each of us better understand love. These are speaking words of affirmation, spending quality time with your partner, receiving gifts, acts of service and physical touch. 

As much as it mentions marriage, this book is not just for couples – or Christian couples, at that – but also for people you care about and have to co-exist with regularly. Most, if not all of us, feel a need to be understood. We connect well with those who ‘get’ us. Identifying which love language a loved one speaks is key to cementing any relationship.

**Chapman mentions the illusion of romantic love, a trick our biology plays on us in order to ensure mating. But once a mate has been secured through marriage, the nature of the relationship changes. The confusion resulting from this change is what leads to broken relationships**. Learning to communicate in the best possible way is key to minimizing misunderstandings. Unchecked misunderstandings accumulate, while depleting what Chapman calls our ‘love tanks’.

He goes into detail when defining these love tanks, which need to be filled through conscious effort and elaborates on what each emotional love language is and means to the person who identifies with it. Chapman stresses that it is important to know, not only a partner’s love language but your own language intimately. 

**This book contains many bible references and could be seen as a Christian work. But I found that the principles discussed made sense even outside a religious construct**. That said, anyone could benefit from this read. Even though you have no intention of applying the methods Chapman describes, it could be interesting to examine a unique perspective of love and relationships. 

{% blockquote %}If it were possible, I would hand this book personally to every married couple… and say, ‘I wrote this for you. I hope it changes your life. And if it does, be sure to give it to someone else.{% endblockquote %}

Sure enough, some claim that this book has saved their marriages. The 5 Love Languages has been translated into about 50 languages, has become a 24 year best-seller and has developed into a franchise.
