=============================

{% endraw %}**The Alchemist** is a well-told story about following our dreams. Describing it like this might make one think it’s more or less like a self-help book but that wouldn’t be doing it justice. In this book, Paulo Coelho tells a story of an Andalusian shepherd who must choose between following his dreams and carrying on with the comfortable life he has grown accustomed to. The beauty of how this story begins is that this intriguing shepherd is not someone who is sitting at home or industriously working at the life his parents expected of him. Instead, he is already pursuing a life he had dreamt of and has settled into the illusion that being a shepherd was the sum total of his dreams. **In other words, he began to pursue his dreams but did not see them through to realizing his version of an ultimate dream.** So even at the beginning of the book, Coelho has already broached the subject of the pursuit of our destinies from a different perspective.

The Alchemist is not the kind of book that seems original in the sense that you’d have never quite heard this story before. It is not a glimpse into a different culture, world or era per se. Actually, it is different in that it tells you what you already, albeit inherently, know. But it tells it to you in a way that somehow feels new, leaving an inspiring impression on the reader. Yes, there is a certain mystical quality to the story but underneath the magic and awe-inspiring imagery is a universal message communicated quite eloquently. It is the kind of message that anyone from anywhere - regardless of one’s religion or lack thereof – can understand and benefit from. 

In this short, 167-page read told more or less as a parable, **Paulo Coelho speaks to anyone who has ever felt that life has no room for your dreams. Or anyone who has found themselves misunderstood by loved ones whilst pursuing a dream.** The plot revolves around the motivated dreamer, his quest to realize his dream of finding treasure and all the people and obstacles he meets along the way. At some point, the shepherd himself gets in his own way and has to learn how to tackle this obstacle; that is, how to deal with himself.

{% blockquote Paulo Coelho %}Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Paulo Coelho %}Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.{% endblockquote %}

This story carries with it a sense of wisdom. Under the numerous metaphors used is always a gem of an idea. So before you take a literal view of the encounters of the protagonist with magic, God and people looking to turn various metals into gold, maybe take a closer look. You won’t regret it. 

One gets the feeling that whoever wrote The Alchemist has surely ‘lived’. And so he has. [Paulo Coelho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Coelho) is a Brazilian writer who wanted to be an author from a young age against his parents’ wishes. He was committed to a mental institution out of which he broke out and travelled the world. Later, he pursued his dream of being a writer and has enjoyed a [successful career](/Wealth). The Alchemist is one of the most widely read books of all time. So this writer has surely lived the lessons he teaches in his fictional tale of the Andalusian shepherd who had a dream and faced dissent and danger to follow it to its completion.

**The Alchemist** is fit for readers of all ages.
 
One last, golden quote:

{% blockquote %}

“I’m the King of Salem,” the old man said.

“Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked, awed and embarrassed.

“For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”

The boy didn’t know what a person’s “Personal Legend” was.

“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”
