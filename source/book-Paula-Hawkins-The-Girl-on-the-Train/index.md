Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train
====================================

This thriller is an intriguing story of dysfunction and instability. Told from the perspectives of three different women, it hinges on the disappearance of one of them. Megan, currently living a life of boredom and discontent, is the victim. Rachel the protagonist is the unreliable, alcoholic witness. Anna takes the role of nemesis to Rachel. In The Girl on the Train, Paula Hawkins creates a tale riddled with plot twists and a questionable array of characters set in contemporary London.

**The Girl on the Train may be considered a book about misfits**. Arguably, Paula Hawkins probes at our empathy. She prompts us to embrace Rachel, despite all her faults. From the get-go, we waver on whether or not Rachel’s memory is to be trusted. Her penchant for alcohol is known to distort her behavior. She sees and does things which she may or may not recall only a day later. Yet she might have some vital information on what happened to Megan. Megan, herself, leads a double life. She appears to be a happily married young woman, yet she is involved with another man and completely disillusioned with the stagnation that has become her existence. Anna is hotly hated by Rachel, having married Rachel’s ex-husband.

When Megan goes missing, Rachel makes it her mission to help with the investigation. But Rachel’s reliability as a witness is called into question. Paula Hawkins effectively creates a troubled character whom some readers may hesitate to sympathize with. But this is one of the strong points of this story. **In The Girl on the Train, we are challenged to consider Rachel’s human condition: her weaknesses, her inability to build a wholesome life for herself and even her physical appearance**. The squalor and chaos in which she lives is described by several undesirable images and events, including underwear soaked in urine and incessant lying. Where Megan and Anna are exuberant and sexy, Rachel is self-pitying and haggard. Yet, surely, we must find some way to connect with her. Hawkins also challenges our attraction to seemingly perfect people. At first, Rachel delights in the image of Megan’s happy marriage, only to discover the deception that holds this image together. All the characters Rachel comes into contact with may not be what they appear to be. She no longer knows who is purely a victim and not also an instigator.

Paula Hawkins’ best-selling Girl on the Train does not adhere to one continuous timescale but jumps from one to the other and back. However, she manages to keep the story going in a suspenseful movement towards solving the mystery – and liking some of these unscrupulous characters. **There is a delicious sense of bewilderment as Rachel is in an intoxicated state through most of the story, so how are we to know what’s what?** At times, whatever we thought we knew is upended, leaving the reader with a reinforced need to keep turning those pages. The Girl on the Train is regularly compared to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl but truly takes on a devious life of its own for adult readers.
