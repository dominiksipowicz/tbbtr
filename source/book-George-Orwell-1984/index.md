====================================

{% endraw %}This classic is the kind of page-turner a reader revisits every few years. 1984 is a tale of a disillusioned city. First published in 1949, the novel is not only a political work of fiction but also a wealth of wisdom. The reader walks away with several quotes which poke at the illusions of the modern world.
 
Set in a grim version of London, the characters in the world of 1984 are born to the rigid smiles of carbon copies of parents. They are raised to the sound of chants calling them to embrace the rules and regulations of the ruling party in a one-party state. They don’t dare to fall in love. Friendship is more or less forbidden. They die mysteriously after accusations of treason made by family members. Throughout their lives, every step and thought is surveilled by an omnipresent entity called Big Brother. Their main purpose is to live according to this Big Brother’s will - who is not to be confused with a religious entity. Religion has no place in this society.

It is not possible to read 1984 and remain the same. The book will -at the very least- change your mood, if not the way you think. **It will stay with you years after you first read it**. The truth and lies are reversed so that the characters in the novel cannot tell the difference after years of manipulation. One line reads:

{% blockquote %}War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength...{% endblockquote %}
 
Another:

{% blockquote %}Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.{% endblockquote %}

Certain parts of it ring true such that it seems George Orwell stepped into the future while he was writing it and then came back to warn the individuals of his day. Although London has not turned precisely into the bleak image George Orwell painted in 1984, there is still a lot to be learned from this novel. For one, **it challenges our assumption that we would be brave and courageous - and win, if presented with the chance to test our will**. We walk around believing that we are better than our ancestors, having improved the human condition immensely over the generations. We are healthier, faster, wiser, more tolerant. Orwell seems to laugh at all this. He mocks our assumptions and pushes us to think about how things really stand now, so that we can see where we are headed.
 
{% pullquote %}Every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.{% endpullquote %}

1984 stands up to the perspective that we can change our own circumstances. Any figment of false hope is blotted out. There is no room for rosy sentimentality or naïve optimism in this story.
 
**That said, the novel is not depressing. No. It is not the type of book that leaves you hollow and wishing you had never picked it up. Rather: it is so frank, it provides the kind of realism that we appreciate**. It does not make you sad for the sake of it. Instead, it builds up so that you pay attention to the lessons behind the grim events. It contributes its own vocabulary which brings the dystopian world of 1984 alive in the reader’s imagination.
 
This story is usually considered the model political thriller. The novel caused quite a stir when it was first published. It was criticized in Jackson County, Florida as containing sexually explicit content and accused of being pro-communist. Ironically, the Soviet Union banned it on the grounds of anti-communism. Really, 1984 is only a brilliant story which demonstrates the power of an idea. It carries with it a gripping idea and carries it gracefully since the story is told so well.
