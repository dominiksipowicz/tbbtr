Clint Emerson’s 100 Deadly Skills:<br>The SEAL Operative's Guide to Eluding Pursuers, Evading Capture, and Surviving Any Dangerous Situation
======================================================================================================

This is a manual for surviving in a dangerous world. An extremely dangerous world. In the first chapter, Emerson’s introduction of his handbook is fear-inspiring. It makes the world seem like a dark place where **everyone** is bound to be attacked or in a life-threatening situation more than a few times in a lifetime. And so: ‘we must be prepared’. Before reading the book, I thought it would be a glimpse into the life and skills of a SEAL operative, not necessarily an actual advisory manual on how to stay alive. As I continued through the first few pages, I began thinking the book would have been perfect for me if I had just started training as a SEAL operative. But, seeing as I am typing this review, it’s safe to say I am not involved in that field. I don’t believe I will need to use any of the skills Emerson teaches, but who knows? I finished the book just in case I get kidnapped someday. 

Emerson offers some handy tips on how to turn simple implements into lethal weapons, self-defense tactics and evasion skills. Should you need to bamboozle facial recognition software, this is where to learn how. Escaping a threat does not have to be a high tech operation. With some ingenuity, you could save yourself or gather any crucial information you need with whatever you have at your disposal.

Heated and strained so that the milk’s casein proteins coagulate into a rubbery, plastic-like substance, the mixture can be molded into any shape, drying to a claylike consistency.{% endblockquote %}

What I found intriguing about the book was, of course, that the author is someone who allegedly lived these experiences. He not only teaches all these clever methods, but he clearly warns that knowing these techniques is not enough. It is of paramount importance to be able to think like an operative because, once you are confronted with a sticky situation, you are bound to follow instinct instead of regurgitating information from memory. So it’s advisable to ensure that the special forces mindset is embedded in your psyche. His instructions are clear and simple so that anyone can understand them. The book is formatted in an engaging manner, making it easy to follow as a manual.

Rightfully so, Emerson does nothing to encourage blind bravado. In 100 Deadly Skills, he gives the reader permission to run from danger, which is the first and wiser course of action. Only when it is impossible to run, should you stay and fight. **The point is to emerge from the altercation in one piece. The message is that of readiness, in place of playing the role of provocateur.**
