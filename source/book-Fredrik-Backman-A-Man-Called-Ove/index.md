Fredrik Backman’s A Man Called Ove
=============================

Fredrik Backman’s A Man Called Ove is the ultimate celebration of the ordinary, old fashioned man. Backman slowly develops the character of Ove (pronounced Oover) so that what we may have disliked about him grows endearing by the end of the book.

**Ove is an acquired taste. He becomes the ultimate example of a human being: flawed but admirable in his own way. He is not the type of hero we could not begin to measure up to. But at the same time, he is not the villain to be despised by readers. Instead, he is utterly and remarkably human.**
 
Fredrik Backman paints a portrait of Ove in chapters alternating between history and the present. This method ensures that we get to know, and like, Ove gradually. His childhood is one influenced by a loving father. He learns about hard work and honor from this authority figure. Ove’s young adulthood is a solitary existence for a while, where he becomes self-sufficient and strong. Life takes on an interesting turn when he meets the second person who will be important to him. Through all the twists, turns and tragedies of his life, this man called Ove remains unchanged. Whatever characteristics he may have developed as a young man only define themselves more potently with time. His opinions do not evolve. Ove seems to take solace and great pride in his static nature. Lately, however, the arrival of two new sets on neighbors has managed to ruin his plans.

In the chapters describing the history of Ove, it is easy to get the feeling one is reading a parable. But before we settle into this style of communication, we are back to the present – complete with its humorous description of what makes a respectable man. We eventually find out that Ove is not the enigma people seem to think he is. We know his simple motivations and envy the innocence with which Ove lives his existence. At the same time, we are horrified by a decision Ove has recently taken. Throughout the remaining chapters, Backman fosters a hope that Ove will realize the goodness of his present circumstances and reverse his decision.

One problem which regularly nags Ove is his own utility. This means that he is often besieged by people who need his help, a breach of peace he certainly does not appreciate. In Ove, Backman develops a gruffness that points out his displeasure with the world and how people operate – especially nowadays. In A Man Called Ove, Backman’s description of Ove’s world leans toward the Kafkaesque and the unfair. Here, ‘men in white shirts’ rule at will. Ordinary people living honest lives are duped and scammed. Tragedy hits just when things are getting better. One is lucky to be able to hold onto what one holds dear.

A Man Called Ove is Fredrik Backman’s first novel and was originally published in Sweden. He has received much acclaim for this good read that is relevant to young readers, as well as adults, who want to take a look at the extraordinary nature of a low key life.
