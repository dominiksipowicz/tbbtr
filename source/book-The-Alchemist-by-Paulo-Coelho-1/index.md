{% endraw %}All young men have destinies they want to realize, things they wanted to accomplish. Few go after their destinies; most give up on them. Do you have a dream you wanted to pursue but never did? Because more important things came up in your life? Because you thought you might fail? Because you spent so long putting it off that it was eventually too late for you to pursue it?

When an Andalusian boy goes to a Gypsy woman in Tarifa to have a recurrent dream interpreted, he is also on the verge of giving it all up. Why wouldn’t he? Why would he go all the way to Egypt to find a hidden treasure? And what if he doesn’t find any? Maybe he should go on looking after his sheep and marry the merchant’s daughter?

{% pullquote %}The Alchemist is a book particularly meant for young people who have dreams they want to realize, especially those who are at the point of giving up on their dreams.{% endpullquote %}

This Andalusian boy is Santiago, a shepherd by choice. He became a shepherd because he wanted to travel the world and sure enough in two-years’ time he had been able to explore all the cities of Andalusia.

Author Paulo Coelho is right when he says, “when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” Nature has set up a path for us to follow and all we have to do is read the omens scattered along the way. These are the signs that keep reminding us about our destiny should we get distracted by other things—which is normally the case.

Some people do not respond to the signs though. They unsuccessfully try to bury their desires but to no avail. Just like Santiago’s father who had himself wanted to travel the world or just like the crystal merchant who had wanted to travel to Mecca but never did. In most cases, it’s the fear of failure that forces us to ignore the omens and put off the idea of doing the things we want to do. You think “maybe not this year, maybe next year I will follow my destiny,” until one day it becomes a distant dream. By then the omens have already vanished and you have no clue how to begin the pursuit. Your destiny, your treasure is buried. And you live under a weight of regret for the rest of your life.

After an encounter with a mysterious old man, Santiago embarks on a journey to find the hidden treasure but he won’t be able to find it right away. A series of events would follow and at each interval, he would be compelled to look back and think about going back to Spain leaving his destiny unrealized. He would have definitely done so had he not listened to the omens. This happens to all of us in our lives. Often when we are on the road to finding our destiny we get distracted by other things that come along the way. These things not only keep us from following our dreams but sometimes lure us into thinking that we should give up on our larger goals and be satisfied with what we have achieved so far. Some people get into the trap and turn back before they have had the taste of success. Make sure you are not one of them.

Personally, this book allowed me to think about my unrealized dream. The omens had been speaking to me for years but I had never paid attention to them. I was already on a journey but had just wandered off to pursue things that were less important and not meaningful. Every now and then a sign would come up and remind me about my unfinished journey but I would ignore it. For me, The Alchemist came as an omen.

The Alchemist inspires people to look into their lives and pursue their own unrealized dreams. Every one of us has a treasure to find and this book might just prove to be the first omen in helping you find it. After all, as Paulo Coelho writes, “it’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”
