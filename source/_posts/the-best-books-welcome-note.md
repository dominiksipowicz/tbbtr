The Best Books - Welcome note
=============================

### The main purpose of this website is to list and review the best books that can teach us something new. 

I will try to structure this website into two types of content.
 * **The main content** - Book reviews - This content I would like to see as a text review, video review or graphical book review
 
 * **blog posts** - like this one you are reading now. I think there is more news around the reading than we think. 
 For example there are lots of mobile apps that we can use to help us reading or different ways how people read books.

### Let me tell you why I decided to create this website. 

It all started when I discovered that if you want to read let say 100 books and you know that you have limited time like me (I read 12 books a year), so you need 10 years to read all of them. You find yourself that you need to choose which to read. And of course you want to make a good choice. So you want to be sure that the book you are going to read is worth your time. The easiest way how to do that is to check "star" rating on amazon, right? 
Well maybe your right but it's not enough. I want to know more about the book before I read it. that's why it's worth to searched for proper review or recommendation from wise people.

### Why books?

My mentor told me once that if you want to learn from the best ones, read their books. Some of the biggest minds of our times are already passed, but they usually leave knowledge in Books. 
Even if you have access to most wise person in the world, sometimes in need time to organize the wisdom and knowledge which take time and practice. Books are prepared exactly with this in mind.  

At the end of this post I would like this website to gain a small community of like minded people that would like to contribute to this idea and publish new book reviews whether it is in text, video or graphical form.
